# Design patterns

This project covers the design patterns as they appear in the _Head First Design Patterns_ book combined with the actual
implementations in the Spring.

## Design principles

* **Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.**  
  Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without
  affecting those that don't.


* **Program to an interface, not an implementation.**  
  This can be also referred as a program to a super type.


* **Favor composition over inheritance.**  
  This allows us to change the behavior of the object at runtime.
