# The Observer Pattern

**The Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of
its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Applicability

Use the Observer pattern when changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual set
of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.

Use the pattern when some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.
